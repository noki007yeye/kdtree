KDTree
======

This is very much a work in progress.

C++ KDTree implementation derived from the C KDTree implementation written 
by John Tsiombikas. The original C version is available at 
[google code](http://code.google.com/p/kdtree) and the specific version 
this was derived from is available at 
[github](http://github.com/sdeming/kdtree) under the git tag 'original'.

The C++ side of this is simply to shore up type casting so it builds with 
a C++ compiler.
